AmneziaWG is a contemporary version of the popular VPN protocol, WireGuard.
It offers protection against detection by Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems.
At the same time, it retains the simplified architecture and high performance
of the original.

The progenitor of AmneziaWG, WireGuard, is known for its efficiency, but
it does have issues with detection due to distinctive packet signatures.
AmneziaWG addresses this problem by employing advanced obfuscation methods,
allowing its traffic to blend seamlessly with regular internet traffic.
As a result, AmneziaWG maintains high performance while adding an extra layer
of stealth, making it a superb choice for those seeking a fast and discreet
VPN connection.
